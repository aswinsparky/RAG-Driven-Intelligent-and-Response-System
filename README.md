# RAG-Driven Intelligent and Response System

## 📌 Overview
The **RAG-Driven Intelligent and Response System** combines **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** with large language models to provide **real-time, context-aware, and human-like responses**.  

Unlike a plain chatbot, this system can **fetch relevant information from a knowledge base** before generating answers, ensuring higher accuracy and reduced hallucinations.  

Key features include:
- 🔎 **Intelligent Retrieval** – fetches the most relevant documents from a vector database.  
- 🧠 **Context-Aware Generation** – augments queries with retrieved content for precise responses.  
- 🔄 **Dynamic Knowledge Base** – easily update documents without retraining the model.  
- 🖼️ **Multi-Modal Support** – handles both text and images as input.  
- 🛠️ **API Integration** – easy to embed into other applications.  
- 📈 **Scalable & Extensible** – designed for large datasets and real-world applications.

## ⚙️ System Architecture
1. **Indexing**  
   - Converts documents into embeddings using a model (e.g., OpenAI, HuggingFace, or Sentence Transformers).  
   - Stores them in a **vector database** (e.g., ChromaDB, Pinecone, FAISS).  

2. **Retrieval**  
   - When a user asks a question, the system searches the vector database for **most similar chunks**.  

3. **Augmentation**  
   - The retrieved context is **merged with the query** using prompt engineering.  

4. **Generation**  
   - The **LLM** (e.g., GPT, Falcon, LLaMA) generates a response based on both the query and retrieved documents.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/aswinsparky/RAG-Driven-Intelligent-and-Response-System.git
cd RAG-Driven-Intelligent-and-Response-System
```

### 2️⃣ Create Virtual Environment
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate      # On Windows
```

### 3️⃣ Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4️⃣ Set Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the root folder and add:
```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
VECTOR_DB_PATH=./vectorstore
```

### 5️⃣ Run the Application
```bash
python app.py
```

## 🧑‍💻 Usage
- Start the server and open your browser at `http://localhost:5000/`.  
- Enter a **question** or upload a **document/image**.  
- The system will:  
  1. Retrieve relevant knowledge chunks.  
  2. Augment the query.  
  3. Generate an **intelligent response**.
